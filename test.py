# average density of FREE ants

# CM is in the 0th chamber
# Measure the average density (average number of ants in area in chamber 0, 1 and 2)
# Expectation: roughly the same density in both chambers

# CM is in the 1st chamber
# Measure the average density (average number of ants in area in chamber 0, 1 and 2)
# Expectation: average density in chamber 1 is higher than in chamber 0
