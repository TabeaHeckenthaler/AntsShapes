Reduce inspected frames for attempt partitioning to every 1th frame
Attempt zone is a capsule.
I cut off experiments once all the points crossed through the slit
Counted as attempt if any corner of the shape is found in the AttemptZone in given frame
Median filter with window 6 s, when separating attempts 
Path length calculation smooths trajectory with Savitzky-Golay (order 2) with window size 1s.
Path length calculation with rot = True as rot. distance * aver_radius
Path length in experiment counted only during attempt
Normalized by maze exit size
Extended run by linear continuation in x direction until all the corners passed the finish line 
Mean of data points with standard deviation divided by sqrt(data points) (standard error of the mean)
